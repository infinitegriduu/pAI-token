#### pAI: Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Token ‚Äî Dual-Track Mining Innovation Model

---

## Abstract

The Ethereum network has proven itself to be the world's first permissionless, transparent, and immutable software application ecosystem. The emergence of smart contracts enables anyone to deploy decentralized applications and achieve interoperability through standard protocols (such as ERC20).

However, traditional ERC20 token distribution methods mostly adopt **ICO/airdrops**, which are easily classified as securities and face centralization risks. In contrast, Bitcoin uses **Proof of Work (PoW) mining** for distribution and is classified as a "commodity".

**pAI** (Proof of AI Token) aims to **combine artificial intelligence with blockchain** to become a **decentralized AI token in the Ethereum ecosystem**. It innovatively adopts a **dual-track mining mechanism**:

- **Traditional PoW Mining (41M pAI, 41%)**: Provides instant rewards, attracting professional miners
- **Linear Release Mining (10M pAI, 10%)**: Incentivizes long-term participation, building a stable community
- **Initial Market Allocation (49M pAI, 49%)**: Ensures liquidity and application implementation

This enables pAI to have both **market driving force** and retain the **security and community-driven nature of decentralized mining**, while achieving fair incentives for long-term holders through an innovative linear release mechanism.

---

## Background

pAI is an ERC20 token written in Solidity 0.8.30, aiming to become a **decentralized AI native asset**.

Unlike traditional tokens that rely on foundations or companies for management, pAI has **no premine, no ICO**, but is governed and distributed through **publicly transparent smart contracts**.

We believe:

- **Artificial Intelligence + Blockchain** is the core combination point of the future
- Decentralized architecture allows global developers and users to share AI economic dividends
- pAI, as an "AI native token", will circulate in multiple scenarios such as **computing power, AI training data, model exchange, and decentralized applications**

### The Importance of Decentralized Tokens

Due to the obvious failure rate of the current ICO market on Ethereum, investors are vulnerable to pseudo-value supported only by speculation. pAI mitigates this problem by providing the Ethereum network with a decentralized Bitcoin-like asset that can serve the role of numerous centralized tokens in a more inviolable and trustless format.

This powerful mechanism frees individuals from using third-party exchanges and third-party custody that are prone to security vulnerabilities and wallet breaches. Moving away from centralization is the core concept of Satoshi Nakamoto's original classic Bitcoin. pAI has the ability to help keep the Ethereum ecosystem open, accountable, trustless, and decentralized at every step of the value transfer process. Unlike Bitcoin, pAI can interact with decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and SushiSwap because it is fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. This means that while Bitcoin can only be traded in a centralized manner, pAI can be traded permissionlessly in immutable permanent smart contracts that cannot be censored or restricted by central entities.

## Name Origin

The meaning of "pAI":

- "p" represents **Proof** and **People (community)**
- "AI" represents **Artificial Intelligence**, symbolizing a new generation of intelligence-driven economy

**Reward Halving Schedule:**

```
Era 0: 100 pAI   ‚Üí Target supply: 69.5M (49M + 20.5M)
Era 1: 50 pAI    ‚Üí Target supply: 79.75M (49M + 30.75M)
Era 2: 25 pAI    ‚Üí Target supply: 84.875M
Era 3: 12.5 pAI  ‚Üí Target supply: 87.4375M
Era 4: 6.25 pAI  ‚Üí Target supply: 88.71875M
Era 5: 3.125 pAI ‚Üí Target supply: 89.359375M
Era 6: 1.5625 pAI ‚Üí Target supply: 89.6796875M
Era 7: 0.78125 pAI ‚Üí Target supply: 90M (final)
```

#### 3. Linear Release Mining (10M pAI, 10%) ‚Äî Innovative Mechanism üåü

- **Purpose**: Incentivize long-term participation, build stable community
- **Mechanism**: Hash power accumulation + time release
- **Features**: Delayed rewards, suitable for long-term holders
- **Daily Reward**: 0.5 pAI/day/miner
- **Requirement**: Submit at least 10 valid hash power proofs per day

**Linear Release Workflow:**

```
1. Miner submits hash power proof (submitHashPower)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Verify PoW (same difficulty as traditional mining)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Accumulate accumulatedHashPower++
   ‚îî‚îÄ No immediate reward

2. Time accumulation (minimum 1 day)
   ‚îî‚îÄ daysPassed = (current time - last claim) / 1 day

3. Claim vesting reward (claimVestingReward)
   ‚îú‚îÄ baseReward = daysPassed √ó 0.5 pAI
   ‚îú‚îÄ requiredHashPower = daysPassed √ó 10
   ‚îî‚îÄ Calculate actual reward:
       if (accumulated >= required)
           actualReward = baseReward (full amount)
       else
           actualReward = baseReward √ó (accumulated / required)
```

**Hash Power Penalty Mechanism Examples:**

```
Scenario 1: Sufficient Hash Power ‚úÖ
- 10 days passed
- Required: 10 √ó 10 = 100 submissions
- Actual: 120 submissions
- Reward: 10 √ó 0.5 = 5 pAI (full amount)

Scenario 2: Insufficient Hash Power ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 10 days passed
- Required: 10 √ó 10 = 100 submissions
- Actual: 50 submissions
- Reward: 5 √ó (50/100) = 2.5 pAI (halved)

Scenario 3: Minimal Hash Power ‚ùå
- 30 days passed
- Required: 30 √ó 10 = 300 submissions
- Actual: 30 submissions
- Reward: 15 √ó (30/300) = 1.5 pAI (only 10%)
```

### Economic Model Advantages

This design ensures:

- **Liquidity**: 49% released in advance, can quickly enter DeFi and application ecosystem
- **Fairness**: 51% through hash power competition, avoiding monopolization by a few
- **Long-term**: 10M linear release pool incentivizes continuous participation
- **Stability**: Dual-track system meets different types of miners' needs

## Mining Mechanism Details

### Traditional PoW Mining

#### Mining Algorithm

pAI uses double Keccak256 (SHA3) algorithm for mining, similar to Bitcoin's double SHA256:

```solidity
// First layer hash
bytes32 innerHash = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(challengeNumber, minerAddress, nonce)
);

// Second layer hash
bytes32 digest = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(innerHash)
);

// Verification
require(uint256(digest) <= miningTarget, "InvalidProofOfWork");
```

**Parameter Description:**

- **nonce**: Random number chosen by mining software
- **minerAddress**: Miner's Ethereum address, prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and supports pool mining
- **challengeNumber**: Recent Ethereum block hash, updated each round to prevent premining
- **miningTarget**: Difficulty target, automatically decreases as network hash power increases

#### Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism

**Adjustment Period**: Every 2048 epochs
**Target Rate**: 40 Ethereum blocks = 1 pAI epoch (~8 minutes)
**Adjustment Range**: ¬±50% (maximum change)
**Difficulty Range**: `2^16` (hardest) ~ `2^234` (easiest)

```solidity
// Mining too fast ‚Üí Increase difficulty
if (ethBlocks < TARGET_BLOCKS_PER_PERIOD) {
    uint256 excessPct = ((TARGET - ethBlocks) * 1000) / TARGET;
    uint256 decrease = (target / 2000) * excessPct;
    miningTarget -= decrease; // Decrease by up to 50%
}

// Mining too slow ‚Üí Decrease difficulty
else {
    uint256 shortagePct = ((ethBlocks - TARGET) * 1000) / TARGET;
    uint256 increase = (target / 2000) * shortagePct;
    miningTarget += increase; // Increase by up to 50%
}
```

#### Double-Spend Prevention Mechanism

```solidity
// Can only mine once per Ethereum block
if (lastRewardEthBlockNumber == block.number) 
    revert AlreadyMinedInBlock();
```

### Linear Release Mining

#### Core Parameters

```solidity
DAILY_VESTING_REWARD = 0.5 pAI        // Daily base reward
REQUIRED_DAILY_HASH_POWER = 10         // Hash power submissions needed for full reward
VESTING_POOL_ALLOCATION = 10,000,000 pAI  // Total release pool
```

#### Miner State Tracking

```solidity
struct MinerStake {
    uint256 accumulatedHashPower;      // Accumulated hash power count
    uint256 lastClaimTime;              // Last claim time
    uint256 totalVestingClaimed;        // Total vesting rewards claimed
}
```

#### Key Functions

**1. submitHashPower(uint256 nonce, bytes32 challenge_digest)**

- Verify proof of work
- Accumulate miner's hash power count
- Initialize new miner state
- Trigger HashPowerSubmitted event

**2. claimVestingReward()**

- Check if 1 day has passed
- Calculate days and required hash power
- Calculate reward based on actual hash power ratio
- Reset hash power counter
- Distribute reward and trigger VestingRewardClaimed event

#### Economic Incentive Analysis

**Theoretical Maximum Output:**

```
Maximum active miners: 10,000,000 / 0.5 = 20,000,000 days = 54,794 years
```

**Actual Scenarios:**

```
- 1,000 active miners: 500 pAI/day
- 10,000 active miners: 5,000 pAI/day
- 100,000 active miners: 50,000 pAI/day
```

## Account System and Security Features

### ERC20 Standard Compatibility

pAI fully implements the ERC20 standard, compatible with all Ethereum wallets and DeFi protocols:

- Metamask
- Ledger Nano
- Trezor
- Trust Wallet
- Any wallet supporting ERC20

### EIP-2612 Permit Support

pAI implements the EIP-2612 standard, supporting gasless approvals:

```solidity
function permit(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external;
```

**Advantages:**

- Users don't need to pre-approve
- Saves one transaction's gas fee
- Improves user experience

### Security Mechanisms

#### 1. Custom Errors (Gas Optimization)

```solidity
error InvalidProofOfWork();        // Invalid proof of work
error AlreadyMinedInBlock();       // Duplicate mining in same block
error MaxSupplyExceeded();         // Maximum supply exceeded
error VestingPoolDepleted();       // Vesting pool depleted
error TooSoonToClaim();            // Too soon to claim
error InsufficientHashPower();     // Insufficient hash power
error ZeroAddress();               // Zero address
error InsufficientBalance();       // Insufficient balance
error InsufficientAllowance();     // Insufficient allowance
error PermitExpired();             // Permit expired
error InvalidSignature();          // Invalid signature
```

#### 2. Reentrancy Protection

Uses "Check-Effects-Interactions" pattern:

```solidity
// ‚úÖ Safe pattern
tokensMinted += reward;          // 1. Update state first
_mint(miner, reward);            // 2. Then mint tokens
challengeNumber = blockhash(block.number - 1);  // 3. Update challenge
```

#### 3. Overflow Protection

Solidity 0.8.30 enables overflow checks by default, using unchecked only in safe places:

```solidity
unchecked {
    // Only use where overflow is impossible
    epochCount++;
    stake.accumulatedHashPower++;
}
```

#### 4. Access Control

```solidity
// Does not accept direct ETH transfers
receive() external payable {
    revert ETHNotAccepted();
}
```

## Pool Mining

When mining pAI, miners must pay a small gas fee each time they submit a solution to execute the smart contract's mint() or submitHashPower() function. To reduce the gas fee burden on miners, they can choose to join pool mining.

### Pool Operation Methods

**Traditional PoW Pools:**

- Pool submits solutions on behalf of miners and pays gas fees
- Pool typically takes a small percentage of rewards, the rest goes to miners providing PoW solutions
- Since the miner's Ethereum address is included in the proof of work, miners must mine using the pool's Ethereum address
- Pool accepts "partial solutions", miners get "shares" from the pool for solutions that are close to valid but not fully valid

**Linear Release Pools:**

- Pool can submit hash power proofs on behalf of miners
- Miners' accumulated hash power belongs to their own address
- Miners can independently claim vesting rewards
- Reduces individual miners' gas costs

This mechanism follows the same methodology as Bitcoin and Ethereum proof-of-work pool mining.

## Economic Model In-Depth Analysis

### Inflation Rate Calculation

#### Traditional PoW Part

**Assumptions:**

- 40 ETH blocks = 1 pAI epoch (~8 minutes)
- Daily epochs = 24 √ó 60 / 8 = 180 epochs

**Daily Production by Era:**

```
Era 0: 180 √ó 100 = 18,000 pAI/day
Era 1: 180 √ó 50 = 9,000 pAI/day
Era 2: 180 √ó 25 = 4,500 pAI/day
Era 3: 180 √ó 12.5 = 2,250 pAI/day
Era 4: 180 √ó 6.25 = 1,125 pAI/day
Era 5: 180 √ó 3.125 = 562.5 pAI/day
Era 6: 180 √ó 1.5625 = 281.25 pAI/day
Era 7: 180 √ó 0.78125 = 140.625 pAI/day
```

**Annualized Inflation Rate (relative to circulation):**

```
Era 0: (18,000 √ó 365) / 49M = 13.4% (first year)
Era 1: (9,000 √ó 365) / 69.5M = 4.7%
Era 2: (4,500 √ó 365) / 79.75M = 2.1%
...
```

### Mining Revenue Model

#### Traditional PoW Revenue

**Single Miner Daily Revenue:**

```
Daily revenue = (Miner hash power / Total network hash power) √ó Daily production √ó Block success rate
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Assumptions:
- Miner hash power: 100 MH/s
- Total network hash power: 10 GH/s (10,000 MH/s)
- Era 0 daily production: 18,000 pAI
- Block success rate: 95%

Daily revenue = (100 / 10,000) √ó 18,000 √ó 0.95 = 171 pAI/day
Monthly revenue = 171 √ó 30 = 5,130 pAI/month
```

#### Linear Release Revenue

**Full Reward Condition:**

```
Submit ‚â• 10 valid hash power proofs per day
```

**Revenue Calculation:**

```
Maximum daily revenue = 0.5 pAI
Maximum monthly revenue = 0.5 √ó 30 = 15 pAI
Maximum annual revenue = 0.5 √ó 365 = 182.5 pAI
```

**Hash Power Shortage Penalty:**

```
Actual revenue = Base reward √ó (Actual hash power submissions / Required hash power submissions)
```

### Total Revenue Comparison

**Professional Miner Strategy:**

- Mainly participate in traditional PoW (high hash power investment)
- Also engage in linear release (low-frequency submission)
- Expected monthly revenue: 5,000+ pAI

**Regular Holder Strategy:**

- Mainly participate in linear release (low-cost participation)
- Occasionally participate in traditional PoW (luck factor)
- Expected monthly revenue: 15-50 pAI

## Hash Power Calculation

### Hash Power Units

```
1 KH/s = 1,000 hashes/second
1 MH/s = 1,000,000 hashes/second
1 GH/s = 1,000,000,000 hashes/second
1 TH/s = 1,000,000,000,000 hashes/second
```

### Block Solution Time Calculation

```solidity
Block solution time (seconds) = (Difficulty √ó 2^22) / Hash power (hashes/second)
```

**Example:**

```
Assumptions:
- Current difficulty: 1,000,000
- Miner hash power: 100 MH/s = 100,000,000 H/s

Solution time = (1,000,000 √ó 2^22) / 100,000,000
              = (1,000,000 √ó 4,194,304) / 100,000,000
              = 41,943 seconds
              ‚âà 11.65 hours
```

### Success Rate Calculation

```
Success probability per attempt = Current difficulty target / Maximum target value
Attempts per second = Hash power (H/s)
Expected solution time = 1 / (Success probability per attempt √ó Attempts per second)
```

## FAQ

### Basic Questions

**Q1: Does pAI have its own blockchain?**
A: No. pAI exists as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows it to leverage a faster, more secure, and modern cryptographic environment while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.

**Q2: What is the total supply of pAI?**
A: The total supply is 100,000,000 pAI (100 million), with no additional issuance.

**Q3: How to obtain pAI?**
A: There are three ways:

1. Participate in traditional PoW mining (instant rewards)
2. Participate in linear release mining (delayed rewards)
3. Purchase on DEX (such as Uniswap, SushiSwap)

### Mining Related

**Q4: What is the difference between traditional PoW and linear release mining?**
A:

- **Traditional PoW**: Instant rewards, intense competition, suitable for professional miners
- **Linear Release**: Delayed rewards, moderate competition, suitable for long-term holders
- Can participate in both types of mining simultaneously

**Q5: How does pool mining work?**
A: Essentially the same as classic Bitcoin pool mining, except that pAI pools must pay gas fees to the Ethereum network. Pools submit solutions on behalf of miners and distribute rewards according to contribution.

**Q6: How often is difficulty updated?**
A: Traditional PoW mining updates every 2048 epochs. The "difficulty" of linear release mining is the same as traditional PoW, but the reward mechanism is different.

**Q7: How is difficulty updated?**
A: Difficulty may increase by up to 100% or decrease by 50%, targeting approximately 8 minutes (40 Ethereum blocks) per pAI epoch.

**Q8: Will there be reward halving events? When?**
A: Yes. Traditional PoW mining halves when reaching specific supply stages:

- Era 0 ‚Üí Era 1: 69.5M tokens
- Era 1 ‚Üí Era 2: 79.75M tokens
- Total of 7 halvings

**Q9: How many hash power submissions are needed per day for linear release mining?**
A: It is recommended to submit at least 10 valid hash power proofs per day to receive full rewards. Less than 10 submissions will result in proportionally reduced rewards.

**Q10: How often can linear release rewards be claimed?**
A: Can be claimed after waiting at least 1 day. The longer the wait, the more accumulated rewards, but requires submitting more hash power proofs accordingly.

### Technical Questions

**Q11: What hashing algorithm does pAI use?**
A: Uses double Keccak256 (SHA3) algorithm, similar to Bitcoin's double SHA256.

**Q12: What kind of hardware do I need for mining?**
A:

- **Traditional PoW**: Recommended GPU mining (such as NVIDIA RTX series)
- **Linear Release**: CPU mining is sufficient (low-frequency submission)

**Q13: Which wallets does pAI support?**
A: Supports all ERC20-compatible wallets, including:

- Metamask
- Ledger Nano
- Trezor
- Trust Wallet
- imToken
- Any wallet supporting ERC20

**Q14: How to view mining statistics?**
A: Can be viewed through:

1. Calling the contract's `getMiningStats()` method
2. Using block explorers (such as Etherscan)
3. Using community-developed mining monitoring tools

### Economic Model

**Q15: Why choose 49% initial allocation?**
A: To balance liquidity and decentralization:

- 49% ensures liquidity at project launch
